        The idea of music as a healing influence which could affect health
        and behavior is as least as old as the writings of Aristotle and
        Plato and in some cultures, long before that. The 20th century
        profession formally began after World War I and World War II when
        community musicians of all types, both amateur and professional,
        went to Veterans hospitals around the country to play for the
        thousands of veterans suffering both physical and emotional trauma
        from the wars. The patients' notable physical and emotional
        responses to music led the doctors and nurses to request the hiring
        of musicians by the hospitals. It was soon evident that the hospital
        musicians needed some prior training before entering the facility
        and so the demand grew for a college curriculum. A very brief
        historical glimpse of this fascinating profession follows, below.

        Earliest references The earliest known reference to music therapy
        appeared in 1789 in an unsigned article in Columbian Magazine titled
        "Music Physically Considered." In the early 1800s, writings on the
        therapeutic value of music appeared in two medical dissertations,
        the first published by Edwin Atlee (1804) and the second by Samuel
        Mathews (1806). Atlee and Mathews were both students of Dr. Benjamin
        Rush, a physician and psychiatrist who was a strong proponent of
        using music to treat medical diseases. The 1800s also saw the first
        recorded music therapy intervention in an institutional setting
        (Blackwell’s Island in New York) as well as the first recorded
        systematic experiment in music therapy (Corning’s use of music to
        alter dream states during psychotherapy).
