          Music Therapy as an Alternative Cancer Treatment
        </h1>
        <p>
          What do we know about music therapy for cancer patients? We know that
          music has a large effect on us in general. It can make us smile when
          we're feeling stressed. It can take us out of a robotic "do" mode and
          put us in touch with our "feeling side." But what about people living
          with cancer? Do studies tell us what our hearts doâ€”that music can make
          a difference?
        </p>
        <h2 className="py-2 mt-5">Emotional and Psychological Benefits</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Better pain control:</b> A decrease in pain was noted in some of
          the studies mentioned, but the effect of music on pain was studied
          specifically among people who were undergoing surgery for lung cancer.
          These patients not only experienced less pain than those who weren't
          offered music therapy but had a reduced need for pain medications.
          Since pain medications can have significant side effects, this was an
          encouraging finding.

          <b>Decreased shortness of breath: </b>At least one study has delved
          into studying the effect of music on the sensation of shortness of
          breath, with music decreasing the sensation of breathlessness while
          providing meaningful spiritual support at the same time.

        <h2 className="py-2 mt-5">Physical Benefits</h2>
        <p>
        <b>Effect of vital signs:</b>Modest improvements in vital signs have been seen among cancer patients participating in music therapy studies, including a decrease in heart rate, a decrease in respiratory rate, and a decrease in blood pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Increase in natural killer cells:</b> A few studies on healthy volunteers have found that listening to music resulted in an increase in number as well as the activity of natural killer cells in the body. Natural killer cells are an aggressive part of our immune system that aids in eliminating cancer cells.

        Of course, there could be a few side effects with music. If the music makes you want to dance a jig the day after you have surgery, this may not be wise. It's probably best as well to avoid music which would remind you of a difficult stage in your life that you don't care to relive. But, in general, music appears to provide some positive comforts with little fear of side effects.
        <p>
        Not all music will be helpful. Hateful music or loud heavy metal might not be the best, but it depends on your personal likes and dislikes.

        <h2 className="mt-5 py-2">Best Music for healing</h2>
       
        <p>
        In studies looking at immune function, it was found that <b><i>"alkaline music"</i></b> was one of the best. Music in this category would include things such as soothing classical music,<b>east Indian music</b> , <b>harp music</b>, and <b>Brazilian guitar</b> for starters.
