            <h1 className='my-4'>What Is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder?</h1>
            <p>Highly stressful, harmful, or upsetting situations or traumatic life events can cause psychological trauma that lingers for months and even years. Sometimes, symptoms of PTSD occur because of upsetting childhood trauma. 
            Health care professionals, police officers, military personnel, and others with stressful jobs are also prone to PTSD, but it can occur in anyone.</p>
            <h2 className='my-4'>Music Therapy for PTSD</h2>
            <p>
            One type of treatment for psychological problems such as PTSD is music therapy. Health care professionals and psychologists have used music to achieve physical and mental wellness in patients with good results. A provider trained in music therapy can tailor the type of music to a person based on their preferences. Listening to soothing music can calm fears and relax tight muscles, helping patients benefit from treatments. Health problems such as high blood pressure, chronic pain, depression and PTSD can often be alleviated with music therapy.

            If you have PTSD, it can make you feel agitated, fearful or depressed and keep you from enjoying activities you like. Music therapy is one way to combat those feelings. Almost everyone responds to music, and most people have a preferred type that helps them calm down and relax. Listening to music in a clinical setting can make you more open to rehabilitation sessions for PTSD. Music helps depression because it gives you something enjoyable to focus on when life may seem meaningless or difficult.

            Music therapy for PTSD can help you push away negative thoughts through the enjoyment of favorite sounds. Sometimes, people can change their feelings by listening to music that reminds them of happy and peaceful times. Music therapy can also be a positive part of self-care. There are two kinds of music therapy: passive and active. Both have shown positive results in PTSD sufferers.

            <h2 className='my-4' >Passive Music Therapy</h2>
            <p>Passive music therapy is the act of listening to music that soothes you or makes you happy. For PTSD sufferers, it can include listening to music while exercising or doing household chores. Or, you might lie down and relax while listening to music you enjoy or use it to achieve a meditative state. PTSD music therapy can not only lift your mood but also positively affect physiological processes such as heart rate.</p>
            <h2 className='my-4'>Active Music Therapy</h2>
            <p>Active music therapy is the creation of music. Rhythmic movements have been found to alleviate stress, calm breathing and improve focus. Like passive music therapy, active music therapy can have a positive effect emotionally and physically. Some people report that it makes them feel more in control and more creative.
